            <h1>Python</h1>
            <p>Python is a programming language. It was made to be open-source and easy to read. A Dutch programmer named Guido van
            Rossum made Python in 1991. He named it after the television program Monty Python's Flying Circus. Many Python examples
            and tutorials include jokes from the show.<br><br>
            
            Python is an interpreted language. Interpreted languages do not need to be compiled to run. A program called an
            interpreter runs Python code on almost any kind of computer. This means that a programmer can change the code and
            quickly see the results. This also means Python is slower than a compiled language like C, because it is not turned into
            machine code ahead of time. Instead, this happens as the program is running.</p>

            <h1>HTML</h1>
            <p>Hyper text markup language (HTML) refers to the principal rack up language used in exhibiting web pages and information
            that can be displayed in an internet browser. A web browser reads HTML credentials and converts them into web pages that
            are observable and perceptible.<br><br>
            
            
            Elements consisting of tags enclosed in position brackets denote HTML. These elements apply as the structure blocks for
            every website built. HTML allows for descriptions and entrenchment of items and application when creating association
            forms. It also offers the means to generate ordered credentials through indicating structural semantics for text in the
            form of headings, paragraphs, lists and associations, among others.<br><br>
            
            Delivery of HTML documents applies means similar to those used by other computer files. In some instances, delivery
            happens through hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP). An HTML element refers to all items between the start and end tags.
            The universal form of HTML elements is in a pair of tags consisting of a start tag and an end tag.<br><br>
            
            Interpretation of HTML by web browsers into structured data does not constitute a programming language. The key feature
            of a programming language is the presence of functional roles. HTML is applicable to structural roles, as it does not
            execute any actions. The key features of HTML that disqualify it as a programming language are lack of restricted
            statements, lack of input and the presence of output, and failure to define functions that can influence information.<br><br>
